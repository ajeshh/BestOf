<!-- where the search can happen
create a search bar for allowing users to search for a venue
and display results of the search (limit to first 10)

 -->

lets do the search bar. 
(should we let the user select a city? hell fuck no. 
That would require figuring out how to do pass the geocoder ip reference to the query..
..
..
..wait I know how to do this! 
BUT! For now lets hard code that shit to be SF, cuz really all the foursquare users of the world either live in SF or NYC. And No NYC company has offered me a job yet and I hate the Jets, Knicks and the Yankees. 
SO yea..its SF)

(also.. you would have to limit to the proximity of the person or redraw based on their map selection)

(map? what is a map.. really .. really? 
Can you really trust a map? I mean..
When was the last time you even used Apple Maps for anything useful?
When I use it its like I interrogate Siri with the following:
"What you were showing on them maps were lies. Were they not?"
Siri: "Some"
Me: "So the answer to my question is “yes, I was not telling the truth,” is it not?"
Siri: "I AM STEPPIN' OUT WITH GOOGLE MAPS!")


lets display the search results
(limit to 20)

let user select a search result and checkin 
OR
let user select a search result and leave a tip

if leaving a tip then its gonna need to show best off
wait..
huh
how..
nooooooo

ok ok ok.. lets get to it..
how?
user has a selection to choose from..
we would need to append their selection with 
#Best {autocomplete} in {area}
UPDATE FROM THE DB

oooo..
what if the autocomplete adds to the list.. every thing adds to the db
this solves a problem
a major one
but can it be done
WHO the fuck knows
WHO THE FUCK KNOWS

ooooo..
fucking use angular for this shit
it can auto fucking update ..
IT CAN FUCKIN AUTO UPDATE!

What else can I use Angular for?
To declare that my app is dead.
ngReadonly, ngDisabled, ngHide, ngUndefined, ngRIP
